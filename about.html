             <p>As Michigan's only professional fraternity with a house, we treasure the constant hub that it provides. Year after year,
                  the house is filled with brothers living along side each other and any brother is always welcome to stop by. This is where 
                  our weekly chapters are held, as well as numerous events, like potlucks! </p>

        <div class = "intro" id = "second">
         <p> The Alpha Beta Chapter of Alpha Chi Sigma was founded in March 1916. Four years later, our first  
          house was purchased, at 727 S State Street. However disaster struck on the morning of December 26, 1923, when a fire caused 
          significant damage to the house.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class = "intro" id = "third">
            <p> With the house repaired and renovated, our chapter thrived until 1942, when enlistment during WWII shrunk our 
                chapter down to just 12 members. Unable to afford the house, we lost it in the fall of 1943. Brothers retained their community
             through lunches at the Michigan League as the hunt for a new house began.
     </div>

      <div class = "intro" id = "fourth">
         <p> In 1947, our current house officially became the house of the Alpha Beta Chapter of Alpha Chi Sigma.
              There was a cook on staff, as well as a house dog named Chemy.</p>

         <p> December 1971 marked the initation of the first women to our chapter. Today, we open our doors to students
              of all genders, backgrounds, and races, striving to maintain a diverse and welcoming community for all those searching 
             for one.  </p>
